My name is Mohith Damarapati. I am a first year computer science master's student at New York University.  Having an experience of two years in applying deep learning techniques to solve problems like foreground extraction, lung cancer prediction and eye-gaze tracking, I am currently looking for summer internship opportunities  to take up complex technical challenges in the areas like machine learning, computer vision, automation and data mining. 
Currently, I am working on the "Image Captioning" problem which falls on the intersection of Machine Vision and Natural Language Processing to automatically generate captions for images.
I did my bachelors in Computer Science at National Institute of Technology, Surat, India where I achieved a GPA of 8.98/10.  



### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
